# CNN Training on CIFAR-10 Dataset

This project demonstrates training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on the CIFAR-10 dataset using Python and Keras. 
## Results

The CNN model is trained for 10 epochs with the following performance:

- Training Accuracy: ~93.44%
- Validation Accuracy: ~91.10%
- Training Loss: ~0.1660
- Validation Loss: ~0.2154
- Accuracy: 92.16%

You can view detailed training progress and results in the `CNN.ipynb` notebook.
